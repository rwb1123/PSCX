# Car parking detection dataset-PSCX
PSCX——Diversity (fog, snow, rain)
## The PSCX dataset is enhanced through the GAN algorithm, adding parking space information in different environments (including fog, snow, sandstorm, rain scenes), which greatly enriches the parking space feature information and contributes to the follow-up work.
1. We divided the PSCX into two parts: one for the augmentation of the whole dataset and the other for the augmentation of the training part (which has been labeled with Coco format).
